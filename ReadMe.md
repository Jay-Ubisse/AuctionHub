AuctionHub is a Web-based project that enables online auctions on the internet.

An organization or sigle person can put the item up for auction and then, the 
bidders are able to walk around the event, making bids on items by writing down
their bid on the signup sheet for the appropriate item.

When the event closes, the bidder with the highest bid for an item wins that item
